# Bling

# What is Bling?
Bling is a lightweight JavaScript library inspired by jQuery.  
It has many of the same functionalities as the original.

# How does it work?
Bling uses simple Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation to get the specific HTML element.  
In the case of multiple of the same HTML elements, Bling gathers them into a node.
Using the element or node, we are able to perform functions on to them similarly to jQuery.

# How do I use it?
Bling is very simple.  
Simply call **$b** function with the HTML tag or identifier as its argument.  
This will gather the element or compile them into a node.  
Functions include: on, off, addClass, removeClass, remove, find, parent, children, html, empty, append, attr
